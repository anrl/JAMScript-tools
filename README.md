# JAMTools

A collection of tools to compile and run JAMScript programs. These tools are best used with the docker version of JAMScript.

*Before you use these tools, you need to setup your account so that docker can run without sudo*. Check the Ubuntu or the particular Linux distribution's documentation to find out how you can setup your system.
